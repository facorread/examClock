# Questions

Q. How do I change the messages?

A. Just click the text area and start typing.

Q. How do I set the total exam time?

A. Just click it and change it.

Q. Why the boring style?

A. White letters on a black background are easier on the eyes than black on white, particularly when looking at a screen or projection. Sans serif letters are easier to read, too. This project is designed to avoid distraction while presenting clear instructions and information.
