# Questions

Q. How do I use this?

A. Download and extract the source code in the classroom computer. Open index.html before students start coming into the classroom. Set the exam time and type your messages, including clarifications about the exam contents, specific questions, glossary, rules, etc. Turn the projector on.

Q. How do I change the messages?

A. Just click the text area and start typing.

Q. How do I set the total exam time?

A. Just click it and change it.

Q. Why the boring style?

A. White letters on a black background are easier on the eyes than black on white, particularly when looking at a screen or projection. Sans serif letters are easier to read, too. This project is designed to avoid distraction while presenting clear instructions and information.

Q. How do I change the font sizes?

A. Zoom in and out using your browser's controls. If you are not satisfied with the results, edit `style.css` and reload.

Q. How do I change the colors, fonts, or sizes?

A. Edit `style.css` and reload.

Q. How can I move the clock and timer away from the borders?

A. In `style.css`, edit the `padding` property in the `.timeTable` block. Reload.

Q. Why do I have to edit `style.css`?

A. Because I do not have the time to design a nice interface and I want to keep this project as simple as it gets. Editing the source code is scary the first time only. You are encouraged to learn to code.
